# The goal

The final goal is to guess what day of the week from a given date.
Say "08/06/1985" is a Tuesday.

## Is it worth to solve it using AI ?

Using AI for this problem is technically unnecessary since algorithms like Zeller's congruence can solve it perfectly with a few lines of code.

## Can AI Solve This?

Yes, AI can definitely solve this problem, though it might seem like overkill for something that has a direct algorithmic solution. However, it makes for an interesting case study in different AI approaches.

## Is it a Deterministic or Nondeterministic problem ?

This is actually a deterministic problem. Given any date, there is exactly one correct day of the week - there's no randomness or uncertainty in the actual answer. The day of the week for any given date follows a precise mathematical formula based on the Gregorian calendar system.
